# hookie monster

a sesame street-themed exploration of basic react hooks, namely `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

you can see it in action [here](https://hookie-monster.pages.dev/), but note you can't edit any of the components that way ;)

## running locally

assuming you have a copy of the repository locally:

1. `cd hookie-monster/frontend`
2. `pnpm i`
3. `pnpm run dev`
4. ???
5. profit!
